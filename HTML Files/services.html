                    <h3>How long does a typical AIM Methodology implementation take?</h3>
                    <p>Implementation timelines vary based on organizational size, complexity, and scope.

                    <h3>How is the AIM Methodology different from other sales methodologies?</h3>
                    <p>The AIM Methodology distinguishes itself through its balanced integration of data-driven analytics with relationship-centered approaches. While many methodologies emphasize either technology or traditional relationship selling, AIM creates sustainable growth systems by optimizing both dimensions simultaneously.</p>
